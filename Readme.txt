This is a basic library management system. It stores all the data in a vector, i.e., when you close the program, all the data will be lost.
To run the program simply compile and run the "ass1.cpp" file
Almost all the data type is string except a few like ISBN.
Since the DB is local, there is a librarian account with userID="123" and password="pass"; use this to login when you first start.
UserID and ISBN are unique. ISBN is a number.
This was tested in Win10 with GNU GCC g++ 9.2.0 on VSC
